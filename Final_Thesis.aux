An illustrated example of the two school of thought concerning the regulation of body weight by a single loci. \textbf  {Left} In the case of reductionist genetics, genes are targeted by knock-down experiments to determine if any have a significant effect on the target phenotypes (body weight). This is done with the assumption that there is a strong direct link between the loci's expression and the phenotype.\textbf  {Right} In the case of systems genetics, it is assume that genetic variants contribute small effect sizes which are pooled to determine the final phenotype. In the systems approach, natural or inbred genetically heterogeneous populations are screened in a consortium of molecular factors which can explain the variation of the phenotype in the population.\relax }}{12}{figure.caption.5}}
