	At some time in the 1780s the Industrial Revolution began—firstly in Britain then in other European countries. Technical and commercial advances enabled European societies to break through their pre-industrial production ceiling, initiating the seemingly limitless multiplication of goods and services. Expanding industry attracted labourers and their families to towns and cities, which grew rapidly, at the expense of rural areas. In terms of economic output these transformations were an immense success; in terms of human wellbeing they were not. Unplanned urbanisation, appalling working conditions, and low wages led to a deterioration in the health of much of the population. In Britain, where these changes occurred first and most rapidly, average life expectancy at birth actually declined during the first half of the 19th century.1 
	
	Infectious diseases exacted a huge toll in morbidity and mortality, among them tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, smallpox, typhoid, and typhus, as well as the “enteric fevers,” whose causes were hotly disputed. We now know that dysentery is caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with faecal micro-organisms in environments where sanitation and access to clean water are inadequate. But at the time popular {\ldots}},

@article{FangThermalInvestigation,
	abstract = {Thermal processes are widely used in small molecule chemical analysis and metabolomics for derivatization, vaporization, chromatography, and ionization, especially in gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). In this study the effect of heating was examined on a set of 64 small molecule standards and, separately, on human plasma metabolite extracts. The samples, either derivatized or underivatized, were heated at three different temperatures (60, 100, and 250 °C) at different exposure times (30 s, 60 s, and 300 s). All the samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and the data processed by XCMS Online (xcmsonline.scripps.edu). The results showed that heating at an elevated temperature of 100 °C had an appreciable effect on both the underivatized and derivatized molecules, and heating at 250 °C created substantial changes in the profile. For example, over 40{\%} of the molecular peaks were altered in the plasma metabolite analysis after hea...},

It requires a spectral library, which contains for all considered peptide precursor ions empirically determined fragment ion intensities and their predicted retention time (RT). RTs, however, are not comparable on an absolute scale, especially if heterogeneous measurements are combined. Here, we present a method for high-precision prediction of RT, which significantly improves the quality of targeted DIA analysis compared to in silico RT prediction and the state of the art indexed retention time (iRT) normalization approach. We describe a high-precision normalized RT algorithm, which is implemented in the Spectronaut software. We, furthermore, investigate the influence of nine different experimental factors, such as chromatographic mobile and stationary phase, on iRT precision. In summary, we show that using targeted analysis of DIA data with high-precision iRT significantly increases sensitivity and data quality. The iRT values are generally transferable across a wide range of experimental conditions. Best results, however, are achieved if library generation and analytical measurements are performed on the same system.},

Data that violate these assumptions can often be brought in line with the assumptions by application of a transformation. Gene-expression microarray data have a complicated error structure, with a variance that changes with the mean in a non-linear fashion. Log transformations, which are often applied to microarray data, can inflate the variance of observations near background. Results: We introduce a transformation that stabilizes the variance of microarray data across the full range of expres-sion. Simulation studies also suggest that this transforma-tion approximately symmetrizes microarray data.},

Here, we examine mitochondrial links to liver metabolism through the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome of 386 individuals in the BXD mouse reference population. Several links were validated between genetic variants toward transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypes. Among these, sequence variants in Cox7a2l alter its protein's activity, which in turn leads to downstream differences in mitochondrial supercomplex formation. This data set demonstrates that the proteome can now be quantified comprehensively, serving as a key complement to transcriptomics, genomics, and metabolomics--a combination moving us forward in complex trait analysis.},

@article{Ghose2011HFD,
	abstract = {AIM Our aim is to investigate the molecular mechanism of regulation of gene expression of drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters in diet-induced obesity. MAIN METHODS Adult male CD1 mice were fed diets containing 60{\%} kcal fat (HFD) or 10{\%} kcal fat (LFD) for 14 weeks. RNA levels of hepatic DMEs, transporters and their regulatory nuclear receptors (NRs) were analyzed by real-time PCR. Activation of cell-signaling components (JNK and NF-$\kappa$Β) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$) were measured in the liver. Finally, the pharmacodynamics of drugs metabolized by DMEs was measured to determine the clinical relevance of our findings. KEY FINDINGS RNA levels of the hepatic phase I (Cyp3a11, Cyp2b10, Cyp2a4) and phase II (Ugt1a1, Sult1a1, Sultn) enzymes were reduced {\~{}}30-60{\%} in HFD compared to LFD mice. RNA levels of Cyp2e1, Cyp1a2 and the drug transporters, multidrug resistance proteins, (Mrp)2, Mrp3 and multidrug resistant gene (Mdr)1b were unaltered in HFD mice. Gene expression of the NRs, PXR and CAR and nuclear protein levels of RXR$\alpha$ was reduced in HFD mice. Cytokines, JNK and NF-$\kappa$Β were induced in HFD mice. Thus reduction in hepatic gene expression in obesity may be modulated by cross-talk between NRs and inflammation-induced cell-signaling. Sleep time of Midazolam (Cyp3a substrate) was prolonged in HFD mice, while Zoxazolamine (Cyp1a2 and Cyp2e1 substrate)-induced sleep time was unaltered. SIGNIFICANCE This study demonstrates that gene-specific reductions in DMEs can affect specific drugs metabolized by these enzymes, thus providing a rationale to monitor the effectiveness of drug therapy in obese individuals.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

However, the increased number of experiments using knockout mice requires identification of their estrous cycle as well, since (in)fertility issues may arise. In mice, like rats, the identification of the stage of estrous cycle is based on the proportion of cell types observed in the vaginal secretion.

@article{Bolstad2003,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. RESULTS We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. AVAILABILITY Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

	abstract = {TRIzol solubilization and extraction is a relatively recently developed general method for deproteinizing RNA. This method is particularly advantageous in situations where cells or tissues are enriched for endogenous RNases or when separation of cytoplasmic RNA from nuclear RNA is impractical. TRIzol (or TRI Reagent) is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidinium isothiocyanate that simultaneously solubilizes biological material and denatures protein. After solubilization, the addition of chloroform causes phase separation (much like extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol), where protein is extracted to the organic phase, DNA resolves at the interface, and RNA remains in the aqueous phase. Therefore, RNA, DNA, and protein can be purified from a single sample (hence, the name TRIzol). TRIzol extraction is also an effective method for isolating small RNAs, such as microRNAs, piwi-associated RNAs, or endogeneous, small interfering RNAs. However, TRIzol is expensive and RNA pellets can be difficult to resuspend. Thus, the use of TRIzol is not recommend when regular phenol extraction is practical.},

Although the use of microarrays to generate gene expression data has become routine, applications pertinent to clinical microbiology continue to rapidly expand.

This method classifies a population into branch-like segments that construct an inverted tree with a root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes. The algorithm is non-parametric and can efficiently deal with large, complicated datasets without imposing a complicated parametric structure. When the sample size is large enough, study data can be divided into training and validation datasets. Using the training dataset to build a decision tree model and a validation dataset to decide on the appropriate tree size needed to achieve the optimal final model. This paper introduces frequently used algorithms used to develop decision trees (including CART, C4.5, CHAID, and QUEST) and describes the SPSS and SAS programs that can be used to visualize tree structure. 概述 决策树是一种常用的数据挖掘方法，用于多变量分析时建立分类系统或制定预测结果变量的算法。此方法将一个数据群分割成分枝状节段，构造出包括根节点、内部节点和叶节点的倒置形树状模型。该算法运用非参数方法，不需要套用任何复杂的参数模型就能有效地处理大型复杂的数据库。当样本足够大时，可将研究数据分为训练数据集和验证数据集。使用训练数据集构建决策树模型，使用验证数据集来决定树的适合大小，以获得最优模型。本文介绍了构建决策树的常用算法（包括CART，C4.5，CHAID和QUEST），并描述了SPSS和SAS软件中将树结构可视化的程序。. 中文全文 本文全文中文版从2015年X月X日起在http://dx.doi.org/10.11919/j.issn.1002-0829.XXXXXX可供免费阅览下载.},

Although there are numerous studies addressing mutation frequencies, morphological or transcriptional changes in aging mammalian tissues, few have measured global changes at the protein level. Here, we present an in depth proteomic analysis of three brain regions as well as heart and kidney in mice aged 5 or 26 months, using stable isotope labeling of whole animals (SILAC mouse) and high resolution mass spectrometry. In the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions of the brain, more than 4200 proteins were quantitatively compared between age groups. Proteome differences between individual mice were observable within and between age groups. However, mean protein abundance changes of more than twofold between young and old mice were detected in less than 1{\%} of all proteins and very few of these were statistically significant. Similar outcomes were obtained when comparing cerebellum, heart, and kidney between age groups. Thus, unexpectedly, our results indicate that aging-related effects on the tissue proteome composition at the bulk level are only minor and that protein homeostasis remains functional up to a relatively high age.},

We find that 84{\%} of an individual human genome can be sequenced confidently. This high-confidence region includes 91.5{\%} of exon sequence and 95.2{\%} of known pathogenic variant positions. We present the distribution of over 150 million single-nucleotide variants in the coding and noncoding genome. Each newly sequenced genome contributes an average of 8,579 novel variants. In addition, each genome carries on average 0.7 Mb of sequence that is not found in the main build of the hg38 reference genome. The density of this catalog of variation allowed us to construct high-resolution profiles that define genomic sites that are highly intolerant of genetic variation. These results indicate that the data generated by deep genome sequencing is of the quality necessary for clinical use.},

In this review we highlight some salient contributions of the mouse in aging research: lifespan intervention studies in the Interventions Testing Program of the National Institute on Aging; identification of the genetic underpinnings of the effects of calorie restriction on lifespan; the Aging Phenome Project at the Jackson Laboratory, which has submitted multiple large, freely available phenotyping datasets to the Mouse Phenome Database; insights from spontaneous and engineered mouse mutants; and complex traits analyses identifying quantitative trait loci that affect lifespan. We also show that genomewide association peaks for lifespan in humans and lifespan quantitative loci for mice map to homologous locations in the genome. Thus, the vast bioinformatic and genetic resources of the mouse can be used to screen candidate genes identified in both mouse and human mapping studies, followed by functional testing, often not possible in humans, to determine their influence on aging.},

@article{Coen2010,
	abstract = {Metabonomics involves the application of advanced analytical tools to profile the diverse metabolic complement of a given biofluid or tissue. Subsequent statistical modelling of the complex multivariate spectral profiles enables discrimination between phenotypes of interest and identifies panels of discriminatory metabolites that represent candidate biomarkers. This review article presents an overview of recent developments in the field of metabonomics with a focus on application to pre-clinical toxicology studies. Recent research investigations carried out as part of the international COMET 2 consortium project on the hepatotoxic action of the aminosugar, galactosamine (galN) are presented. The application of advanced, high-field NMR spectroscopy is demonstrated, together with complementary application of a targeted mass spectrometry platform coupled with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Much novel mechanistic information has been gleaned on both the mechanism of galN hepatotoxicity in multiple biofluids and tissues, and on the protection afforded by co-administration of glycine and uridine. The simultaneous identification of both the metabolic fate of galN and its associated endogenous consequences in spectral profiles is demonstrated. Furthermore, metabonomic assessment of inter-animal variability in response to galN presents enhanced mechanistic insight on variable response phentoypes and is relevant to understanding wider aspects of individual variability in drug response. This exemplar highlights the analytical and statistical tools commonly applied in metabonomic studies and notably, the approach is applicable to the study of any toxin/drug or intervention of interest. The metabonomic approach holds considerable promise and potential to significantly advance our understanding of the mechanistic bases for adverse drug reactions.},

@article{Gillet2012TargetedAnalysis,
	abstract = {Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However, with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly, consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially any protein of interest. It consists of using the information available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor isolation windows (swaths). This SWATH MS acquisition setup generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400-1200 m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window. We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.},

@article{Kafri2006Thecircuits,
	abstract = {Functional redundancies, generated by gene duplications, are highly widespread throughout all known genomes. One consequence of these redundancies is a tremendous increase to the robustness of organisms to mutations and other stresses. Yet, this very robustness also renders redundancy evolutionarily unstable, and it is, thus, predicted to have only a transient lifetime. In contrast, numerous reports describe instances of functional overlaps that have been conserved throughout extended evolutionary periods. More interestingly, many such backed-up genes were shown to be transcriptionally responsive to the intactness of their redundant partner and are up-regulated if the latter is mutationally inactivated. By manual inspection of the literature, we have compiled a list of such "responsive backup circuits" in a diverse list of species. Reviewing these responsive backup circuits, we extract recurring principles characterizing their regulation. We then apply modeling approaches to explore further their dynamic properties. Our results demonstrate that responsive backup circuits may function as ideal devices for filtering nongenetic noise from transcriptional pathways and obtaining regulatory precision. We thus challenge the view that such redundancies are simply leftovers of ancient duplications and suggest they are an additional component to the sophisticated machinery of cellular regulation. In this respect, we suggest that compensation for gene loss is merely a side effect of sophisticated design principles using functional redundancy.},

@article{Lorenz2010Performancebarley,
	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may benefit from utilizing haplotype information for making marker-phenotype associations. Several rationales for grouping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into haplotype blocks exist, but any advantage may depend on such factors as genetic architecture of traits, patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the study population, and marker density. The objective of this study was to explore the utility of haplotypes for GWAS in barley (Hordeum vulgare) to offer a first detailed look at this approach for identifying agronomically important genes in crops. To accomplish this, we used genotype and phenotype data from the Barley Coordinated Agricultural Project and constructed haplotypes using three different methods. Marker-trait associations were tested by the efficient mixed-model association algorithm (EMMA). When QTL were simulated using single SNPs dropped from the marker dataset, a simple sliding window performed as well or better than single SNPs or the more sophisticated methods of blocking SNPs into haplotypes. Moreover, the haplotype analyses performed better 1) when QTL were simulated as polymorphisms that arose subsequent to marker variants, and 2) in analysis of empirical heading date data. These results demonstrate that the information content of haplotypes is dependent on the particular mutational and recombinational history of the QTL and nearby markers. Analysis of the empirical data also confirmed our intuition that the distribution of QTL alleles in nature is often unlike the distribution of marker variants, and hence utilizing haplotype information could capture associations that would elude single SNPs. We recommend routine use of both single SNP and haplotype markers for GWAS to take advantage of the full information content of the genotype data.},

@article{Czyz2012Geneticdifferences,
	abstract = {Genetic-epidemiological studies on monozygotic (MZ) twins have been used for decades to tease out the relative contributions of genes and the environment to a trait. Phenotypic discordance in MZ twins has traditionally been ascribed to non-shared environmental factors acting after birth, however recent data indicate that this explanation is far too simple. In this paper, we review other reasons for discordance, including differences in the in utero environment, genetic mosaicism, and stochastic factors, focusing particularly on epigenetic discordance. Epigenetic differences are gaining increasing recognition. Although it is clear that in specific cases epigenetic alterations provide a causal factor in disease etiology, the overall significance of epigenetics in twin discordance remains unclear. It is also challenging to determine the causality and relative contributions of environmental, genetic, and stochastic factors to epigenetic variability. Epigenomic profiling studies have recently shed more light on the dynamics of temporal methylation change and methylome heritability, yet have not given a definite answer regarding their relevance to disease, because of limitations in establishing causality. Here, we explore the subject of epigenetics as another component in human phenotypic variability and its links to disease focusing particularly on evidence from MZ twin studies.},

	abstract = {Glutathione (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine; GSH) is the most abundant low-molecular-weight thiol, and GSH/glutathione disulfide is the major redox couple in animal cells. The synthesis of GSH from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine is catalyzed sequentially by two cytosolic enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and GSH synthetase. Compelling evidence shows that GSH synthesis is regulated primarily by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity, cysteine availability, and GSH feedback inhibition. Animal and human studies demonstrate that adequate protein nutrition is crucial for the maintenance of GSH homeostasis. In addition, enteral or parenteral cystine, methionine, N-acetyl-cysteine, and L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate are effective precursors of cysteine for tissue GSH synthesis. Glutathione plays important roles in antioxidant defense, nutrient metabolism, and regulation of cellular events (including gene expression, DNA and protein synthesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis, signal transduction, cytokine production and immune response, and protein glutathionylation). Glutathione deficiency contributes to oxidative stress, which plays a key role in aging and the pathogenesis of many diseases (including kwashiorkor, seizure, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, liver disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, HIV, AIDS, cancer, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes). New knowledge of the nutritional regulation of GSH metabolism is critical for the development of effective strategies to improve health and to treat these diseases.},

@article{Sell20072aminoadipic,
	abstract = {We hypothesized that the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues in longlived proteins oxidatively deaminates with age forming the carbonyl compound, allysine (alpha-aminoadipic acid-delta-semialdehyde), which can further oxidize into 2-aminoadipic acid. In the present study, we measured both products in insoluble human skin collagen from n=117 individuals of age range 10-90 years, of which n=61 and n=56 were non-diabetic and diabetic respectively, and a total of n=61 individuals had either acute or chronic renal failure. Allysine was reduced by borohydride into 6-hydroxynorleucine and both products were measured in acid hydrolysates by selective ion monitoring gas chromatography (GC)-MS. The results showed that 2-aminoadipic acid (P{\textless}0.0001), but not 6-hydroxynorleucine (P=0.14), significantly increased with age reaching levels of 1 and 0.3 mmol/mol lysine at late age respectively. Diabetes in the absence of renal failure significantly (P{\textless}0.0001) increased 2-aminoadipic acid up to {\textless}3 mmol/mol, but not 6-hydroxynorleucine (levels{\textless}0.4 mmol/mol, P=0.18). Renal failure even in the absence of diabetes markedly increased levels reaching up to {\textless}0.5 and 8 mmol/mol for 6-hydroxynorleucine and 2-aminoadipic acid respectively. Septicaemia significantly (P{\textless}0.0001) elevated 2-aminoadipic acid in non-diabetic, but not diabetic individuals, and mildly correlated with other glycoxidation markers, carboxymethyl-lysine and the methylglyoxal-derived products, carboxyethyl-lysine, argpyrimidine and MODIC (methylglyoxal-derived imidazolium cross-link). These results provide support for the presence of metal-catalysed oxidation (the Suyama pathway) in diabetes and the possible activation of myeloperoxidase during sepsis. We conclude that 2-aminoadipic acid is a more reliable marker for protein oxidation than its precursor, allysine. Its mechanism of formation in each of these conditions needs to be elucidated.},

The formation of cross-links was elegantly demonstrated by Verzar over 40 years ago but the nature and mechanisms are only now being unravelled. Cross-linking involves two different mechanisms, one a precise enzymically controlled cross-linking during development and maturation and the other an adventitious non-enzymic mechanism following maturation of the tissue. It is this additional non-enzymic cross-linking, known as glycation, involving reaction with glucose and subsequent oxidation products of the complex, that is the major cause of dysfunction of collagenous tissues in old age. The process is accelerated in diabetic subjects due to the higher levels of glucose. The effect of glycation on cell-matrix interactions is now being studied and may be shown to be an equally important aspect of ageing of collagen. An understanding of these mechanisms is now leading to the development of inhibitors of glycation and compounds capable of cleaving the cross-links, thus alleviating the devastating effects of ageing.},

@article{Beard2002,
	abstract = {Predicting behavior of large-scale biochemical networks represents one of the greatest challenges of bioinformatics and computational biology. Computational tools for predicting fluxes in biochemical networks are applied in the fields of integrated and systems biology, bioinformatics, and genomics, and to aid in drug discovery and identification of potential drug targets. Approaches, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), that account for the known stoichiometry of the reaction network while avoiding implementation of detailed reaction kinetics are promising tools for the analysis of large complex networks. Here we introduce energy balance analysis (EBA)--the theory and methodology for enforcing the laws of thermodynamics in such simulations--making the results more physically realistic and revealing greater insight into the regulatory and control mechanisms operating in complex large-scale systems. We show that EBA eliminates thermodynamically infeasible results associated with FBA.},

@article{Traut1994,
	abstract = {The concentrations of bases, nucleosides, and nucleosides mono-, di- and tri-phosphate are compared for about 600 published values. The data are predominantly from mammalian cells and fluids. For the most important ribonucleotides, average concentrations +/- SD (microM) are: ATP, 3,152 +/- 1,698; GTP, 468 +/- 224; UTP, 567 +/- 460 and CTP, 278 +/- 242. For deoxynucleosides-triphosphate (dNTP), the concentrations in dividing cells are: dATP, 24 +/- 22; dGTP, 5.2 +/- 4.5; dCTP, 29 +/- 19 and dTTP 37 +/- 30. By comparison, dUTP is usually about 0.2 microM. For the 4 dNTPs, tumor cells have concentrations of 6-11 fold over normal cells, and for the 4 NTPs, tumor cells also have concentrations 1.2-5 fold over the normal cells. By comparison, the concentrations of NTPs are significantly lower in various types of blood cells. The average concentration of bases and nucleosides in plasma and other extracellular fluids is generally in the range of 0.4-6 microM; these values are usually lower than corresponding intracellular concentrations. For phosphate compounds, average cellular concentrations are: Pi, 4400; ribose-1-P, 55; ribose-5-P, 70 and P-ribose-PP, 9.0. The metal ion magnesium, important for coordinating phosphates in nucleotides, has values (mM) of: free Mg2+, 1.1; complexed-Mg, 8.0. Consideration of experiments on the intracellular compartmentation of nucleotides shows support for this process between the cytoplasm and mitochondria, but not between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.},

@article{VanEunen2010,
	abstract = {Realistic quantitative models require data from many laboratories. Therefore, standardization of experimental systems and assay conditions is crucial. Moreover, standards should be representative of the in vivo conditions. However, most often, enzyme-kinetic parameters are measured under assay conditions that yield the maximum activity of each enzyme. In practice, this means that the kinetic parameters of different enzymes are measured in different buffers, at different pH values, with different ionic strengths, etc. In a joint effort of the Dutch Vertical Genomics Consortium, the European Yeast Systems Biology Network and the Standards for Reporting Enzymology Data Commission, we have developed a single assay medium for determining enzyme-kinetic parameters in yeast. The medium is as close as possible to the in vivo situation for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and at the same time is experimentally feasible. The in vivo conditions were estimated for S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK113-7D grown in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures at an extracellular pH of 5.0 and a specific growth rate of 0.1 h(-1). The cytosolic pH and concentrations of calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur and magnesium were determined. On the basis of these data and literature data, we propose a defined in vivo-like medium containing 300 mM potassium, 50 mM phosphate, 245 mM glutamate, 20 mM sodium, 2 mM free magnesium and 0.5 mM calcium, at a pH of 6.8. The V(max) values of the glycolytic and fermentative enzymes of S. cerevisiae were measured in the new medium. For some enzymes, the results deviated conspicuously from those of assays done under enzyme-specific, optimal conditions.},

@article{Paltiel2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many cohort studies, biological specimens are being stored without specific plans for analyses. In the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study biological specimens (DNA, plasma, and whole blood) are stored on 96-well plates and as a result may undergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles. METHODS: To explore the impact of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on chemical constituents, we conducted a quality control study using pooled EDTA-plasma. Over a two-year period, samples stored at -80 degrees C were subjected up to 100 freeze-thaw cycles. Specimens were analyzed in triplicate for sodium, cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin E, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and free fatty acids. We assessed the percent change of analyte concentration from the values for the first freeze-thaw cycle, because this is the baseline for all stored specimens. RESULTS: With the exception of free fatty acids, there was little change over the first 10 freeze-thaw cycles. A majority of analytes showed no significant changes until 30 freeze-thaw cycles. After 30 freeze-thaw cycles, the largest percent change was observed for free fatty acids (+32{\%}), AST (+21{\%}), and triglycerides (-19{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Human plasma can go through several freeze-thaw cycles before analysis without influencing sample integrity for the selected analytes.},

@article{Schellenberger2010,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions under the Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) framework are valuable tools for analyzing the metabolic capabilities of organisms and interpreting experimental data. As the number of such reconstructions and analysis methods increases, there is a greater need for data uniformity and ease of distribution and use. DESCRIPTION We describe BiGG, a knowledgebase of Biochemically, Genetically and Genomically structured genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. BiGG integrates several published genome-scale metabolic networks into one resource with standard nomenclature which allows components to be compared across different organisms. BiGG can be used to browse model content, visualize metabolic pathway maps, and export SBML files of the models for further analysis by external software packages. Users may follow links from BiGG to several external databases to obtain additional information on genes, proteins, reactions, metabolites and citations of interest. CONCLUSIONS BiGG addresses a need in the systems biology community to have access to high quality curated metabolic models and reconstructions. It is freely available for academic use at http://bigg.ucsd.edu.},
